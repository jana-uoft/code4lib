# Docker Compose

`https://docs.docker.com/compose/`

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

With a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
  * Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
  * Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
  * Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire app.

Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:
  * Start, stop, and rebuild services
  * View the status of running services
  * Stream the log output of running services
  * Run a one-off command on a service
